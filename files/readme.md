## Dealing with the new manifest file

A Manifest file for registering Tower is required but cannot be provided as part of this demo.  The manifest file needs to be downloaded and placed in this repo's files folder `files/manifest.zip`, alongside this readme.

  See obtaining a subscription manifest for Tower [here](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible-tower/latest/html/userguide/import_license.html#obtaining-a-subscriptions-manifest)
